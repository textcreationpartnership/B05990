            <title>Strange news from Westmoreland. Being a true relation of one Gabriel Harding, who coming home drunk, struck his wife a blow on the breast and killed her out right; then did he forswear the evil deed which he knew himself guilty of. Likewise how a stranger did come to the house cloathed in green, the people that were eye witnesse said it was an angel. Likewise how the stranger or angel did give sentence upon the man for killing of his wife. Also how Satan did break the mans neck that did forswear himself; and the stranger or angel did command Satan to hurt none else, and to vanish: which being done, there was a pleasant harmony of musick heard to sound: then did the stranger cloathed in green, take his leave of the people; whereof the chiefest in the parish desired it might be put in print, and have hereunto set their hands. To the tune of, In summer time.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>A ſight preſently will appear;</l>
                  <l>Let all your truſt be in the Lord,</l>
                  <l>No harm ſhall be while I am here.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then in the Room the Devil appear'd,</l>
                  <l>Like a brave Gentleman did ſtand:</l>
                  <l>Satan, quoth he that was the Iudge,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Devil then in an ugly ſhape,</l>
                  <l>He danced round about the Hall,</l>
                  <l>Which made the people much afraid</l>
                  <l>He had ſuch fearful looks withal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Devil then he ſtraight laid hold</l>
                  <l>On him that had murdered his Wife,</l>
                  <l>His neck in ſunder then he brake,</l>
                  <l>And thus did end his wretched life.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Devil then he vaniſhed</l>
                  <l>Quite from the people in the Hall,</l>
                  <l>Which made the people much amaz'd,</l>
                  <l>Yet no one had no hurt at all.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Than ſtraight a pleaſant melody</l>
                  <l>Of muſick ſweet was heard to ſound,</l>
                  <l>It raviſht the hearts of thoſe ſtood by</l>
                  <l>So ſweet the Muſick did abound.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now quoth this gallant man in green,</l>
                  <l>With you I can no longer ſtay,</l>
                  <l>My love I leave, my leave I take,</l>
                  <l>The time is come I muſt away.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Be ſure to love each other well,</l>
                  <l>Keep in your breaſt what I do ſay,</l>
                  <l>It is the way to go to Heaven</l>
                  <l>When you ſhall riſe at Judgement Day.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The people to their homes did go</l>
                  <l>Which had this mighty wonder ſeen,</l>
                  <l>And ſaid it was an Angel ſure,</l>
                  <l>That thus was cloathed all in green.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And thus the news from <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi>
